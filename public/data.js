This four or five day hike to Enchanted Valley is the Olympics at their best – crossing creeks and rivers, navigating through mossy forests, and breaking into stunning, wide open meadows. And despite penetrating deep into the heart of the Olympics, the elevation change on this trip is moderate – the only heart-pounding on this trail will be from the views.",
